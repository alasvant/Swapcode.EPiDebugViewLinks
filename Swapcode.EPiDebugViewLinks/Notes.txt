*** BEFORE CREATING THE NUGET ***

- Increase the AssemblyInformationalVersion value in AssemblyInfo.cs (if creating a new release obviously)
- change release notes in Swapcode.EPiDebugViewLinks.nuspec file


*** CREATING THE NUGET PACKAGE, RUN THESE COMMANDS IN COMMAND PROPMPT ***

Run the "ZipBuildAndPack.bat" in command prompt


OR the following commands:

powershell -command "Compress-Archive -Path .\Views\, .\module.config -DestinationPath .\Modules\_protected\EPiDebugViewLinks\EPiDebugViewLinks -CompressionLevel Optimal -Force"

nuget pack Swapcode.EPiDebugViewLinks.csproj -Build -Properties Configuration=Release -Verbosity detailed







*** BUILD ACTION : NONE ***

All files under Views should be "Build Action": None because these files are added to the zip file
module.config is also added to the zip file so its "Build Action" is also set to None

The root web.config Build Action is none as we don't want to include it to the NuGet package









*** HISTORY AND MISC ***

packages.config edited manually:
- Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform package, added attribute: developmentDependency="true"
  - done so that the package is not added as a dependency, it is there only because asp.net mvc empty template was used to create the project


NuGet nuspec file created with command : nuget spec Swapcode.EPiDebugViewLinks.csproj

Manually edited the Swapcode.EPiDebugViewLinks.nuspec file, only the $version$ is left to the file which will be populated during nuget pack

First create the zip of the module
PS script to create the ZIP of the module : https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.archive/compress-archive?view=powershell-6
